# SDK Licence Agreement

This **SDK Licence Agreement** (“Agreement”) is between **Comodule OÜ** with its place of business at **Dunkri 9, 10123 Tallinn, Estonia** (“Comodule”) and the person or entity accessing, installing or using the licenced software and any associated documentation (“You”). The terms also apply to documentation for the application programming interfaces (collectively the “APIs”) and any software code provided by Comodule in conjunction with such documentation. The software code, documentation, APIs, and other materials made available by Comodule are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the **SDK**. This Agreement defines each party’s rights in the SDK.

**BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SDK, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE SDK.**

The SDK is made available by Comodule to integrate and enable certain functionality into Your applications to facilitate the sale of online advertising space. This Agreement applies to any SDK that includes, displays, or links to this Agreement, and to any updates, supplements, or support services for the SDK, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those other terms apply.

## 1. Grant of Licence

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Comodule grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free licence to:

- modify, distribute, or convey the SDK so that the SDK becomes subject to any licence which requires, as a condition of licence, use, modification, distribution, or conveyance, that (1) the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; (2) others have the right to modify or create derivative works of it; and/or (3) it becomes redistributable at no charge.

You will:

- distribute the object code under the terms and conditions of an end-user licence agreement which requires that end-users not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the SDK, Comodule file formats, Comodule protocols, and/or any part thereof; and which requires end-users to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Comodule from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of Your Developed Programs;

Despite anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Comodule may, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the SDK at any time. You acknowledge that termination of Your rights and/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if You breach this licence and that Comodule will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to seek injunctive or equitable relief in the event of a breach. Upon any termination of this Agreement, You must (a) destroy or return to Comodule all full and partial copies of the SDK and (b) discontinue distribution of any Developed Programs.

## 16. General Provisions

This Agreement is not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, by You, whether involuntarily, by merger, operation of law or otherwise, without Comodule’s prior written consent. Any attempted transfer in violation of this Section is void. A waiver of any default hereunder or of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not be deemed to be a continuing waiver or a waiver of any other default or of any other term or condition, but will apply solely to the instance to which such waiver is directed. The exercise of any right or remedy provided in this Agreement will be without prejudice to the right to exercise any other right or remedy provided by law or equity, except as expressly limited by this Agreement.

In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be severed from the remainder of this Agreement, and such remainder will remain in force and effect. The parties agree to replace any such invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to this subject matter and supersedes all prior and/or simultaneous representations, discussions, negotiations and agreements relating to the SDK, whether written or oral.
